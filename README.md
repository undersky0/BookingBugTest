#Booking Bug developers test

Ruby 2.2.0 Rails 4.2.1

- The answers to questions 1,2,3,4  can be found in models/bug_api.rb and assets/javascript/blog_api.js including specs.

- For question 5 I used db/structure.sql for creating tables and inserting data. Wasn't sure how I was expected to create
them, but I remember you mentioning during the interview that there is still a lot of legacy code. Thats why it seemed
like a good idea to write SQL like that. rake db:setup stills works.

Thank you for consideration
